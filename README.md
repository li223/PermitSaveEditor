# PermitSaveEditor
A simple save editor for Potion Permit. Inspired by me not wanting to constantly re-edit the code everytime there's an update. Might come up with a catchier name.

# Saves File Location
The save files are located in `/Users/USER/AppData/LocalLow/MasshiveMedia/Potion Permit` and should be numbered according to the file slot. Highly recommend making a backup copy of this file in case something goes wrong.

# XYZ doesn't work
If something doesn't work, open an issue and I might have a look. It's been a long time since I played this game so a lot will be missing or have changed. Feel free to add to it if I don't.

Also due to how the game functions, some level stuff might be locked behind a quest meaning that changing the level in the save won't do anything functionally.
